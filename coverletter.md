# Cover Letter: Solutions Engineer 



I'm writing to express my interest in the Solutions Engineer position at Fonoa. Your work in simplifying global tax compliance for digital businesses through API-driven automation aligns with my experience in supporting complex technical systems in regulated environments.

## Relevant Experience

At Modivcare Labs, I supported an API-based SaaS product for non-emergency medical transportation, which involved navigating various regulatory requirements. This experience provided insights into managing compliance challenges in a digital context. For instance, I:

- Troubleshot API integration issues using Postman, ensuring efficient data flow between our system and healthcare providers' platforms.
- Collaborated with our development team to implement a new feature that automated certain compliance checks, significantly reducing manual processes.
- Communicated technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, bridging the gap between our product capabilities and client expectations.

Your API documentation at [docs.fonoa.com](https://docs.fonoa.com) reflects a well-designed system aimed at streamlining tax processes. The modular approach of your product suite reminds me of a project where I helped design a modular reporting system, allowing for customization to meet varying compliance standards across different states.

## Key Skills

My background aligns with several key aspects of the Solutions Engineer role:

1. **Conducting technical discovery:** At Modivcare, I led discovery sessions with new clients, identifying their specific needs and mapping them to our product capabilities.
2. **Developing implementation plans:** I created and executed implementation plans for our largest clients, considering their existing systems and compliance requirements.
3. **Balancing customer requirements with product capabilities:** I often acted as a bridge between our product team and customers, advocating for feature enhancements that would meet emerging market needs while aligning with our product roadmap.


Thank you for your consideration.
